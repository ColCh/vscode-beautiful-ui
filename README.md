A collection of [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) themes inspired from
the awesome [Sublime DA CS](https://github.com/ihodev/sublime-da-cs).

I am not at all the original author of the color scheme. This project was born
out of a necessity. I was a user of Sublime Text and Sublime DA UI for a long time.

Due to many reasons (mainly VSCode's intellisense and JS friendliness) I had to
switch to VSCode and the only thing I felt missing was the awesome UI engine made
by [Ihor Oleksandrov](https://github.com/ihodev) and compatible themes.

So this is my attempt to fill the gap. Personally I've been using Tomorrow Night
theme for a long time and I have put effort to port as many themes as possible.

> * I am not original author of any of the color schemes.
> * Syntax highlighting differs from the DA UI and DA CS, but I have managed to keep as much as possible. Also in some cases I have increased the darkness of colors for light themes.
> * If you like any color theme, go and ❤️ the original authors.

## Installation

## Development

> Help porting the themes from sublime da cs.

The development is made easy with some custom scripts. First fork and clone the
repo and run

```bash
yarn install
```

This will install all dependencies. Then run

```bash
yarn start
```

To build the themes and watch for file changes. You can press <kbd>F5</kbd> to
launch VSCode development window where you can preview the themes.

Once satisfied run

```bash
yarn build
```

to finalize the themes and make changes to `package.json` manually.

Then submit a PR.

### Adding a new theme

* Copy `./src/schemes/Template.noop.js` to `./src/schemes/MyTheme.js`.
* Mark the theme `dark` or `light` and make changes accordingly.
* Add colors to the config.
* Import and add the theme in `src/colors.js`.
* Build and test.
